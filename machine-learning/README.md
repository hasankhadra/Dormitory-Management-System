# Siamese Network for Matching Students in Dormitory

This Python class implements a Siamese Network to match students in a dormitory based on their profiles. A Siamese Network is a neural network architecture that learns to compare two inputs and output a similarity score between them. In this case, the two inputs are the profiles of two students, and the output is a score indicating how well these two students match.
